# Read Me

This project is to kick off a 100 days of code project. Over the course of the next 100 days I plan to spend a minimum of 30 minutes a day writing Python code. There will be a primary focus on doing small projects that are data science focused.


### Project Ideas

- Develop a time series monitor for cryptocurrencies
- Build a streamlit app to compare artists music libraries
- Build a streamlit app that analyzes 76ers player box scores each week

### Linked projects
